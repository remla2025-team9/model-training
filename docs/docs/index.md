# model-training documentation!

## Description

This project provides a complete machine learning pipeline for training sentiment analysis models on restaurant reviews. It uses DVC (Data Version Control) to manage data and model versioning, along with automated CI/CD workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

### Key Features

- **Automated data pipeline**: From raw text to trained models using DVC
- **Text preprocessing**: Uses external preprocessing library with CountVectorizer
- **Model training**: Logistic regression classifier for sentiment analysis
- **CI/CD integration**: Automated testing, linting, and model deployment
- **Version control**: Full reproducibility with DVC and Git
- **AWS integration**: Remote storage for data and model artifacts


## Future Documentation

This documentation is currently minimal and serves as a foundation. We plan to expand it with:

- **API Reference**: Detailed function and class documentation
- **Advanced Usage**: Custom model configurations and parameters
- **Deployment Guide**: Production deployment strategies
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Contributing Guide**: Development workflow and contribution guidelines
- **Architecture Overview**: Detailed system design and component interactions

For now, please refer to the main [README.md](../../README.md) for comprehensive setup and usage instructions.
