# Sentiment Analysis Model Training

This repository contains tools and scripts to train, evaluate, and export a sentiment analysis model in a decoupled, versioned, and reproducible manner.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or newer
* Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Install your preprocessing library:

  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/remla2025-team9/lib-ml.git
  ```
---

## Usage
Standalone preprocess + train + eval on a given dataset :

```bash
python src/train.py \
  --train-input path/to/training/data.tsv \
  --model-output destination/path/of/model.joblib \
  --version x.x.x \
  --model-type [dn|logistic] \
```

Both scripts output:

* A classification report (printed to console)
* A confusion matrix (printed to console)
* Saved model artifact (`.joblib`)

## CI/CD

On every Git tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`), the `.github/workflows/train-release.yaml` workflow will:

1. Checkout the code
2. Install dependencies
3. Run `preprocess.py`
4. Run `train.py` or `improved_train.py`
5. Upload `models/model-v<tag>.pkl` as a GitHub Release asset

The public download URL will be:

```
https://github.com/remla2025-team9/model-training/releases/download/vx.y.z/sentiment_pipeline-vx.y.z.joblib
```

## Model integration
The trained model can now be integrated and used for predictions

### 1. From a GitHub Release
Each stable version tag `vX.Y.Z` has its model attached as a release asset:
```
https://github.com/remla2025-team9/model-training/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/sentiment_pipeline-vX.Y.Z.joblib
```
In your code or service, set the URL and fetch at startup:
```python
import os
import pathlib
import requests
import joblib

MODEL_URL = os.getenv(
    "MODEL_URL",
    "https://github.com/remla2025-team9/model-training/releases/download/v1.2.3/"
    "sentiment_pipeline-v1.2.3.joblib"
)
```
Download and cache the model:
```python
cache_dir = pathlib.Path("/cache/models")
cache_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
local_path = cache_dir / pathlib.Path(MODEL_URL).name

if not local_path.exists():
    resp = requests.get(MODEL_URL)
    resp.raise_for_status()
    local_path.write_bytes(resp.content)
```
Load the model:
```python
model = joblib.load(local_path)
```
### 2. From a local file
It is also possible to load the model from a local file, either by cloning the repo and following the steps above to train and generate the model, or by downloading the model file directly from the GitHub release page.
